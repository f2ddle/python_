# Welcome to my profile!
## I sometimes upload projects that i made while learning in school.
### They're going to be very simple, so they might be able to help you to start learning programming in python and maybe some other programming languages if i make something.
#### Enjoy!
##### My Projects:

###### A basic calculator with 4 basic mathematical operations, except it can also calculate square roots and exponents
###### TURTLE RACE:
###### Self-explanatory, just a turtle race made in python. The turtles were named after Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
###### SNAKE:
###### Self-explanatory as well, just a basic snake game
